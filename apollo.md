### APOLLO MUSIC IMPROVISING

A project using rule based plus data driven methods to help composers to study and improvise music, including scales, chords, rhythms and more. It features a very easy to use yet very powerful browser-based pianoroll, with some built-in AI tools to assist music analysis and creation. 

The project is 100% in pure Javascript.

It's a long-term one and currently still in early stage.

Some screenshots showing the recent progress:
