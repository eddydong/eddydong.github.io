### APOLLO MUSIC IMPROVISING

A project using rule based plus data driven methods to help composers to study and improvise music, including scales, chords, rhythms and more. It features an easy to use yet very powerful browser-based pianoroll written from scratch and some customized AI capabilities built from scratch to assist music analysis and improvisation. 

The project is 100% in pure Javascript.

It's a long-term one and currently still in early stage. 

( The project started in 2022 before the advent of Generative AI )

Some screenshots showing the recent progress:
