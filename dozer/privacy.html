<p>DozerVPN Privacy Policy</p>
<p></p>
<p>DozerVPN is committed to protecting your privacy. We want you to understand what information we collect, what we don’t collect, and how we collect, use, and store information. We do not collect logs of your activity, including no logging of browsing history, traffic destination, data content, or DNS queries. We also never store connection logs, meaning no logs of your IP address, your outgoing VPN IP address, connection timestamp, or session duration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Our guiding principle towards data collection is to only collect the minimal data required to operate a world-class VPN service at scale. We designed our systems to not have sensitive data about our customers; even when compelled we cannot provide data that we do not possess.</p>
<p></p>
<p>This privacy policy will help you understand how Dozer LLC. (“DozerVPN”, “we”, “our”, or “us”) collects, uses, and stores information.</p>
<p></p>
<p>General Information</p>
<p></p>
<p>DozerVPN collects two types of information:</p>
<p></p>
<p>(i) Information related to your account ("personal information")</p>
<p>This information is collected for the purpose of administering your DozerVPN subscription, and includes your email address, and payment information, which you submit on our order page when you subscribe for the Services.</p>
<p></p>
<p>(ii) Aggregate Apps and VPN connection summary statistics</p>
<p>DozerVPN collects minimal information about usage In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service. The section below describes in detail what specific information we collect. These statistics never include anything about what the user did with the VPN: no data about the contents or destinations of VPN traffic, no DNS queries, and no IP addresses.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Personal Information</p>
<p></p>
<p> We require that you provide personal information, such as an email address and payment information, in order to establish an DozerVPN account, and so that we can email you, collect payments from you, and respond to support queries that you initiate. </p>
<p></p>
<p>DozerVPN uses your email address for the following reasons:</p>
<p></p>
<p>To send emails related to payment transactions;</p>
<p>To provide links to our Site, including password reset emails;</p>
<p>To communicate with you about your VPN services or respond to your communications;</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aggregate Apps and VPN Connection Summary Statistics</p>
<p></p>
<p>We ensure that we never log browsing history, traffic destination, data content, IP addresses, or DNS queries. Therefore:</p>
<p></p>
<p>We do not know which user ever accessed a particular website or service.</p>
<p>We do not know which user was connected to the VPN at a specific time or which VPN server IP addresses they used.</p>
<p>We do not know the set of original IP addresses of a user’s computer.</p>
<p>Should anyone try to compel DozerVPN to release user information based on any of the above, we cannot supply this information because the data don’t exist.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In order to maintain excellent customer support and quality of service, DozerVPN collects the following information related to your VPN usage:</p>
<p></p>
<p>Apps and Apps versions</p>
<p>We collect information related to which Apps and Apps version(s) you have activated. Knowing your current version of the Apps allows our customer support team to troubleshoot technical issues with you.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Successful connection</p>
<p>We collect information about whether you have successfully established a VPN connection on a particular day (but not a specific time of the day), to which VPN location (but not your assigned outgoing IP address), and from which country/ISP (but not your source IP address). This minimal information assists us in providing technical support, such as identifying connection problems, providing country-specific advice about how to best use our service, and to enable DozerVPN engineers to identify and fix network issues.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Aggregate sum of data transferred (in MB)</p>
<p>We collect information regarding the total sum of data transfer you consume. Although we provide unlimited data transfer, if we notice that a single user pushes more traffic than thousands of users combined, thereby affecting the quality of service for other DozerVPN users, we may contact them for an explanation.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Summary</p>
<p>We collect minimal usage statistics to maintain our quality of service. We may know, for example, that our customer Mike had connected to our New York VPN location on Tuesday and had transferred an aggregate of 345 MB of data across a 24-hour period. Mike can’t be uniquely identified as responsible for any specific behavior because his usage pattern overlaps with thousands of other DozerVPN customers who also connected to the same location on the same day.</p>
<p></p>
<p>We’ve engineered our systems to categorically eliminate storage of sensitive data. We may know THAT a customer has used DozerVPN, but we never know HOW they have utilized our service. We stand by our firm commitment to our customers’ privacy by not possessing any data related to a user’s online activities.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Jurisdiction and Applicable Law</p>
<p>DozerVPN’s core mission is to keep your information private. In service of this mission, DozerVPN’s headquarters and registered place of business is in British Virgin Islands(BVI), which has stricter laws concerning information disclosure than most countries.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The BVI has no data retention laws, and any legal order requiring a BVI company to disclose customer records must come from the BVI High Court. Under BVI law, information requests from foreign courts or law enforcement are subject to a ‘dual criminality’ provision, meaning that the request is upheld by the BVI High Court only if the same crime is punishable by at least a one-year prison sentence under BVI law, had it taken place in the BVI. Should we receive a valid legal order from the BVI High Court, it is important to note that DozerVPN does not collect any IP addresses, browsing history, traffic data, or DNS queries that could be used to identify any specific user.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Storing of Information of Emails</p>
<p>DozerVPN keeps records of any correspondence, questions, complaints, or compliments you submit to us through emails, along with our response. Depending on how you contact DozerVPN, we may collect your email address and any additional information you provide to us. Having full correspondence records enables our staff to provide the best possible customer support experience.</p>
<p></p>
<p>When you correspond with us using emails, your correspondence records, including your name and email address, are stored in their systems. Our email platform utilizes modern security practices and HTTPS encryption.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Security Measures to Protect Your Information</p>
<p>DozerVPN uses best-in-class physical, procedural, and technical security with respect to our offices and information storage facilities so as to prevent any loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, or modification of information. Access to user information is restricted to staff who require such access to perform their job functions.</p>
<p></p>
<p>While we believe these systems are robust, it is important to understand that no data security measures in the world can offer 100% protection.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Servers are housed in data centers with strong security practices. None of these data centers require us to collect or store any traffic data or personal information related to your use of VPN Services. If any data center were to ask us to log such data, we would immediately cease operations with said data center and find alternative options.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Even if a government were to physically seize one of our VPN servers and manage to break their disk encryption, there would be no logs or information that would tie any individual user to a particular event, website, or behavior.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Third-party Websites</p>
<p>The Site may contain links to external websites that do not fall under DozerVPN’s domain. DozerVPN is not responsible for the privacy practices or content of such external websites.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Consent and Age Restrictions</p>
<p>By using the Site, Content, Apps, Software, or Services, you agree to have your information handled as described in our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Services are intended for adults aged 18 and above. If you believe your child has provided information to us, please let us know immediately.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Changes to the Privacy Policy</p>
<p>We may change our Privacy Policy from time to time, without prior notice to you, consistent with applicable privacy laws and principles. Your continued use of the Site or Services constitutes your acceptance of our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p></p>
