<p>8. Third-party Websites</p>
<p>DozerVPN may provide you with content belonging to Third Parties (“Third Parties”) or links leading to third-party websites. DozerVPN is not responsible for the availability of the content provided by Third Parties as they are not under the control or supervision of DozerVPN, and they may have different terms of use and policies. Your access through our Services to any website, service, or content provided by Third Parties does not indicate any relationship between DozerVPN and such Third Parties.</p>
<p></p>
<p>9. Disclaimers</p>
<p>We will strive to prevent interruptions to the Site and Services. However, these are provided on an “as-is” and “as-available” basis, and we do not warrant, either expressly or by implication, the accuracy of any materials or information provided through the Site or Service, or their suitability for any particular purpose. We expressly disclaim all warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including but not limited to warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement. We do not make any warranty that the Services will meet your requirements, or that it will be uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free, or that defects, if any, will be corrected. You acknowledge that you access the Site and Services at your sole risk and discretion.</p>
<p></p>
<p>VPN service coverage, speeds, server locations, and quality may vary. DozerVPN will attempt to make the Service available at all times. However, the Service may be subject to unavailability for a variety of factors beyond our control, including but not limited to emergencies; third-party-service failures; or transmission, equipment, or network problems or limitations, interference, or signal strength; and may be interrupted, refused, limited, or curtailed. We are not responsible for data, messages, or pages lost, not delivered, delayed, or misdirected because of interruptions or performance issues with the Service, communications services, or networks. We may impose usage or Service limits, suspend Service, terminate VPN accounts, or block certain kinds of usage in our sole discretion to protect Subscribers or the Service. The accuracy and timeliness of data received is not guaranteed; delays or omissions may occur.</p>
<p></p>
<p>DozerVPN reserves the right to investigate matters we consider to be violations of these Terms. We may, but are not obligated to, in our sole discretion and without notice, remove, block, filter, or restrict by any means any materials or information that we consider to be actual or potential violations of the restrictions set forth in these Terms, and any other activities that may subject DozerVPN or our customers to liability. DozerVPN disclaims any and all liability for any failure on our part to prevent such materials or information from being transmitted over the Service and/or into your computing device.</p>
<p></p>
<p>10. Limitations of Liability</p>
<p>DozerVPN shall not be liable and shall not have responsibility of any kind to any Subscriber or other individual for any loss or damage that you incur in the event of:</p>
<p></p>
<p>any failure or interruption of the Site or Service;</p>
<p>any act or omission of any Third Party involved in making the Site or Service or the data contained therein available to you;</p>
<p>any other cause relating to your access or use, or inability to access or use, any portion of the Site or its Content;</p>
<p>your interactions on the Site or Service;</p>
<p>your failure to comply with this Agreement;</p>
<p>the cost of procurement of substitute goods or services; or</p>
<p>unauthorized access to or alteration of your transmissions or data, whether or not the circumstances giving rise to such cause may have been within the control of DozerVPN or of any vendor providing software, services, or support for the Site or Service.</p>
<p>In no event will DozerVPN, its partners, affiliates, subsidiaries, members, officers, or employees be liable for any direct, special, indirect, consequential, or incidental damages, or for any other loss or damages of any kind, even if they have been advised of the possibility thereof. The foregoing shall not apply to the extent prohibited by applicable law.</p>
<p></p>
<p>11. Indemnification</p>
<p>You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless DozerVPN, its officers, directors, employees, members, partners, agents, and suppliers, and their respective affiliates, officers, directors, employees, members, shareholders, partners, and agents, from any and all claims and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Content and Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement. We may, at our sole discretion, assume the exclusive defense and control of any matter subject to indemnification by you. The assumption of such defense or control by us, however, shall not excuse any of your indemnity obligations.</p>
<p></p>
<p>12. Choice of Law</p>
<p>This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the British Virgin Islands(BVI), excluding its rules governing conflicts of law.</p>
<p></p>
<p>13. Arbitration</p>
<p>All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the use of the Site or Services shall be finally settled under the Rules of Arbitration (“Rules”) of the International Centre for Dispute Resolution (ICDR) by one arbitrator (“Arbitrator”) appointed in accordance with said Rules. The arbitration shall be conducted in the BVI, unless all parties agree otherwise by a signed written agreement.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Arbitrator must be qualified and have a background in the area of computer networks, including but not limited to the internet.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Arbitrator shall have the authority to permit an expedited exchange of documents, but any discovery shall be limited to document requests and interrogatories. The Arbitrator shall have no power or authority to add to or detract from this Agreement, and the costs of the arbitration shall be borne equally, except as described below.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The arbitration shall be conducted on an expedited schedule. The arbitration must be concluded, and an award issued, no later than one hundred and twenty (120) days following the filing of the demand for arbitration, unless all parties to the arbitration proceeding agree in writing to an extension of time or continuance.</p>
<p></p>
<p>Subject to any applicable law to the contrary, you agree that any cause of action arising out of or related to the use of our Site or Services must be commenced within one (1) year after the cause of action accrues, or such action will be permanently barred.</p>
<p></p>
<p>In the event that DozerVPN is the respondent in any such arbitration, damages awarded against DozerVPN may not exceed the amount you have paid DozerVPN for use of the Service.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The Arbitrator shall have the authority to grant any temporary, preliminary, or injunctive relief in a form substantially similar to that which would otherwise be granted by a court of law. The Arbitrator shall have no authority to award punitive damages. The resulting arbitration award may be enforced, or injunctive relief may be sought, in any court of competent jurisdiction in the BVI. Reasonable costs (including all costs of arbitration) and attorney’s fees shall be awarded against the party that commenced the arbitration, in the event that party does not prevail in the arbitration.</p>
<p></p>
<p>The parties subject to this arbitration provision include DozerVPN, its officers, directors, and employees, and any company or legal entity which is a parent, subsidiary, or sister company to DozerVPN, or with which DozerVPN has contracted to provide services to Subscribers through DozerVPN.</p>
<p></p>
<p>14. Final Provisions</p>
<p>If any provision in this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to reflect the original intent of the provision, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect. Any failure to exercise or enforce any right or the provision of this agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
