With love, for my son Mars Z. Dong.

### GRAVITY SIMULATION

Imagine a cosmic dance where planets, stars, or even tiny particles tug on each other through gravity, each influencing every other in a chaotic waltz. This is the n-body problem: a simulation where n objects, like asteroids or galaxies, interact with one another, with every pair's gravitational pull calculated to predict their paths. The challenge? Each object computes its attraction to the remaining n-1, leading to n squared interactions—a computational beast that grows wildly with more bodies. From simulating solar systems to modeling black holes, this setup reveals nature's intricate choreography, but it demands clever tricks to tame its complexity.
