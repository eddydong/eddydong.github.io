# EDDY'S SECRET GARAGE

## SOLAR SIMULATION FOR MY SON, MARS

This is your spaceship. Use arrow key Up/Down for speed up/down, left/right for steering. "A"/"Z" to zoom in/out, "Q"/"W" to accelerate/decelerate in time.

To build this, I started off by researching on the physics behind the curtain, like the [Wikipedia on the Elliptic orbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_orbit) and ...

Then I setup an annimation loop to visualize all objects and their ever changin properties.
